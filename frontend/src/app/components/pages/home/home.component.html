        <p>I'm currently on a journey of transitioning to a new career path. The past four years were an incredible learning experience as a chemical process engineer.
           Through this role, I've developed my analytical skills, learned various unit operations, calculations, and process flowcharts. However, I have decided to pursue my passion for software development and make a career change. I am excited to see where this new path takes me and look forward to all the opportunities that lie ahead. </p>
