          I'm currently on a journey of transitioning to a new career path. The past four
          years were an incredible learning experience as a chemical process engineer. Through this role, I've developed
          my analytical skills, learned various unit operations, calculations, and process flowcharts.

        <p class="text">
          In 2022, I followed my passion for technology and software engineering and decided to switch to the field of
          software development. I moved to Canada to join the Software Engineering Technician program at Centennial
          College.

          After completing my formal education, I've been on an exciting learning journey, working on personal projects
          that showcase my skills in software development. These projects have not only helped me enhance my technical
          abilities but also demonstrated my knack for applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          As I transition into this new career path, I bring with me the analytical mindset and problem-solving
          abilities of an engineer, combined with a newfound expertise in software development. I am eager to contribute
          to innovative projects and collaborate with dynamic teams to create impactful software solutions. I am excited
          to see where this new path takes me and look forward to all the opportunities that lie ahead.
